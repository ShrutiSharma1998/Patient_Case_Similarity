# Patient_Case_Similarity


The project aimed to easen the burden on doctors. After analysing the various symptoms of patients we train the model to identify the disease and the relevant medicines for that disease. On a succefull implementation, it can be used in a hospital, where it can keep on continuously learn from patients data, and increase the accuracy of the model. 

1. Created a dataset, with various disease and it's symptoms
2. The training of the dataset is conducted on Jupyter Lab.
3. The webpage to run the code is done using JAVA, Css , HTML
4. Python Flask API is used to connect the training model with the webpage. 
5. Javascript is utilised to enable the functionalities on the webpage.
6. Currently the model was able to identify 42 different diseases. 
7. The project was implemented successfully, and can later be mixed with Machine learning to improvise with big dataset.
